# 10K-VEXCode
This GitHub repository serves as the central hub for all current and past driver, autonomous, and competition code developed by 10K Robotics since November 18, 2023.

Guidelines for Repository Usage:
# 1) Organizing Code:

All program folders, those containing the main.cpp and relevant libraries, must be imported into the MAIN branch of the repository.
Failure to adhere to this guideline may result in intervention by Gary to ensure compliance. You don't want to experience that. Trust me.

# 2) Updating Code:

Before starting any coding session, make sure to pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository to incorporate any updates made by other team members prior to your session.
In case of conflicts during the pull, promptly communicate and resolve the conflicts through the team Discord channel with the person responsible for the changes.

# 3) Committing Changes:

After completing a coding session with modifications, commit and push your changes back to the MAIN branch.
This ensures that the entire team has visibility into and can access the latest modifications.
