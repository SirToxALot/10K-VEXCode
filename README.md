# 10K-VEXCode
This github repository contains all current and past driver, autonamous, and competition code for 10K Robotics since November 18, 2023.

Guidelines for using this repo:
  1) All program folders (one's that contain the main.cpp and all relevent libraries) should be important in the MAIN branch of the repository. If you screw this up, Gary will come find you and make sure you don't do it again (you don't wanna find out).
  2) Whenever you start a session to work on ANY code in the repo, make sure you pull from the github repo to update to any changes. If there are any conflicts, please say something in the team discord to resolve those conflicts with whoever made those changes.
  3) After finishing a session with changes, commit and push your changes back to the MAIN branch, so the rest of the team can view and access those changes you make.

Any questions regarding the use of this repository should be sent to # Gary Fu:
